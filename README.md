## Templates
Here's a list of managed templates assembled according to your preferences.
| Name | Description | Maintainer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [**logger.log_flutter**](https://github.com/melodysdreamj/logger.lego-flutter) | Logger is one of the famous log packages in the Flutter community. When you use this package, the location of the logo printed in the console window comes out to the depth you set, making it very easy to use for debugging and more. In this Lego, we've wrapped logger one more time to make it even easier to use. |

## Legos
Here are some Legos that can easily be integrated with lego-flutter.

## How to make lego
1. Click "use template" in the following [template repository](https://github.com/June-Melody/lego-flutter-template) to create your repository.
2. Read the template's README and appropriately fill in the title, introduction, etc.
3. Place the created change files under the lego folder according to the architecture.
4. Write down the parts that need to be manually changed (pubspec, ready.dart, etc.) and the installation section in detail in the README's installation section.
5. If there are any dependent Legos, also write down that part in the Required Legos section.
6. Write down the detailed usage instructions in the usage section.
7. After uploading to GitHub, add the lego-flutter topic like this. (It will be registered under [GitHub topics](https://github.com/topics/lego-flutter).)
